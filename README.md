# üó®Ô∏è Online Discussion Forum (Threads API)

This is a **basic project** for an Online Discussion Forum (like a mini StackOverflow/Reddit).
Currently, it supports **CRUD operations for threads (create, read, update, delete), user authentication with protected routes, view and add comments, search and filters** 
Later, we would extend it with **user profile, replies and upvotes/downvotes**.
